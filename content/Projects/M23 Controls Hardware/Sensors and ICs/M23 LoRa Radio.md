LoRa modules are radio transceiver modules that operate independent of cellular or internet connection. They leverage a proprietary messaging scheme that uses a system of "chirps" to encode bits. This makes it both long-range, and low power, but this comes at the cost of transmission speed. LoRa is also known to be very noise resilient due to its design.

I would highly recommend using [these radio modules](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20029) this year (we should already have a set in the shop). They will allow us to monitor the state of the car remotely, which is *very* useful during competition.

We managed to test the modules towards the end of the year and found the transmission range to be over a kilometer for sure. I expect the range to get better with a little bit of tuning. You can find the [documentation for these modules here](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_LoRaSerial/quick_start/).
