>[!IMPORTANT]
>Engine kill switches are **required** by the Baja rules. For rules legality questions, consult the [rulebook](https://www.bajasae.net/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx). 

In order to modify the stock Kohler engines to fit the Baja kill switches you must follow this [procedure](https://www.bajasae.net/cdsweb/gen/DownloadDocument.aspx?DocumentID=f5be54aa-643d-402c-96ed-0d688acb7739):
1. Remove the cover from the carburetor. *The carburetor is underneath the metal cover protecting the red fuel cutoff lever and the choke*.
2. Disconnect the two wires from the switch at the carburetor
3. Pull the wires to the back of the engine
4. Attach a 2-pin [[M23 Connectors|connector]] of choice to the two leads. Shorting these two leads will kill the engine.
The two kill switches should be **wired in parallel** to this DT connector, so that if either of the kill switches are pressed, the engine dies.

> [!NOTE] 
> Kill switches should be **normally open**.
