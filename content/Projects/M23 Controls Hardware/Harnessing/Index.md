title: Harnessing
---
Harnessing is a critical consideration when designing any electrical system. There are many things that go into robust and effective harness design. I've detailed my knowledge on harnessing in [[Harnessing Guidelines|my harnessing guide]].

I've also included a breakdown of the connectors used on M23 as well as my personal recommendations for connectors [[M23 Connectors|here]].

If you're looking for the harnessing diagram for M23, you can reference [[M23 Harnessing|M23's Harnessing Diagram]].
