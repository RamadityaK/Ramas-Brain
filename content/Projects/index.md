Over the years I've been involved in quite a few projects. Project work is always a great way to push yourself to develop your practical skills while reinforcing your theoretical understanding. Sharing the lessons we've learned from our projects is a great way to advance our collective knowledge base, so I'm a strong believer in open-sourcing my projects.
