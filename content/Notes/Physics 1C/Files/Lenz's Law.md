Lenz's law provides a means by which one can determine the direction of the electromotive force (emf) when using [[Faraday's Law]]. 
	
Lenz's law states that the direction of the induced emf drives current around a wire loop to always oppose the change in magnetic flux that causes the emf.
	
In layman's terms, **the current opposes/resists the change in the magnetic field**. If the field reduces in one direction, current will flow to create a magnetic field in that direction to compensate it momentarily.
