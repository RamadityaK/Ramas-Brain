**Huygens's Principle** describes the propagation of the wave fronts of light by the formation and superposition of *secondary wavelets*. This principle is critical in the study of [[Wave Optics]].

In the image above, we can see that there is a wave front made up of the superposition of infinite **wavelets** that emanate from the previous wave front. If the wave front starts as a line, it will continue as a line (diagram a). If it starts as a circle, then it will continue as a circle (diagram b).
