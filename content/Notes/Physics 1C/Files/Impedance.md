Impedance is the analog to resistance, but in AC! The impedance has a both real and imaginary component, and can be used with Ohm's Law, in place of R, to calculate quantities. Different components have different **reactance**, which when combined, result in the impedance of the circuit.

### Resistors
Resistors in AC can be modelled as such:

To find the real result, we simply take the cosine of the magnitude (the capital letters).
	
The **reactance** of a resistor is simply and is only a real component
$$X_R = R$$
### Inductors
The reactance of an inductor is
$$X_L = j\omega L$$
Where j is the complex number i.
### Capacitors
The reactance of the capacitor is 
$$X_C = -\frac{j}{\omega C}$$
