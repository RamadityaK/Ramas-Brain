Hi! My name is Ramaditya Kotha. I'm currently an undergrad studying Electrical Engineering at UCLA. This is my digital garden, a collection of my projects, notes, and thoughts that I've decided to share on the internet!

Some of my interests include photography, embedded systems, machine learning, and control theory.

This website is a work in progress and will constantly be changing and evolving with my knowledge and experiences.
