Hi! My name is Ramaditya Kotha. I'm currently an undergrad studying Electrical Engineering at UCLA. This is my digital garden, a collection of my [[Projects/index|projects]], [[Notes/Index|notes]], and thoughts that I've decided to share on the internet!

Some of my interests include embedded systems, machine learning, and control theory.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, woodworking, and cycling!

If you're interested in what I've been up to, check out some of my [[Projects/index|projects]]!

If you're a recruiter or hiring, check out my [[Portfolio/Index|portfolio]].
